A simple collection of who I am, and what I have done. This is a project that I took on that gave me valuable experience in starting from scratch, and using the skills that I have developed, to build something that I was ultimately happy with. This project is not complete, as I will always be adding to this as I gain more knowledge and understanding, so that is something that I am extremely excited about! 

### Credit
During my build process, I utilized our class material, MDN docs, as well as W3 schools.
